Lab 1: Setup
============

The techlab can be done with a local docker setup or if you are attending a instructor lead lab you will use the hosted lab environment.

Local Docker Setup
==================

1. Follow the instructions here to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. **On first launch** Create ssh keys for master and slave:

        source local_env/create-ssh-keys.sh

3. Start with docker-compose. Depending on your docker installation you may need to run this with `sudo`:

        docker-compose -f local_env/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

4. Login to jenkins at localhost:8080 with:

        user: default
        password: default

**Optional** Some optional labs require a docker capable agent. Do enable this start the environment with:

        docker-compose -f local_env/docker-compose.yml -f local_env/dind.yaml up -d --build

Hosted Lab Setup
================

The techlab setup involves starting a Jenkins Slave on your notebook and connecting it
to a Jenkins master running on an OpenShift 3 environment. An OpenShift client is needed
to establish the connection.

**Note** Lab 1.2 and 1.3 are used for [Lab 8](08_tools.md) and following.

Lab 1.1: Environment
--------------------

Set environment variables with your techlab username and password:

    export TLUSER=<myusername>
    export TLPASS=<mypassword>

Lab 1.2: OpenShift Client
-------------------------

1. Follow the instructions here to install the OpenShift 3 client:
<https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli>

2. Log into OpenShift:

        oc login ose3-lab-master.puzzle.ch:8443 -u ${TLUSER} -p "${TLPASS}"

3. Forward the JNLP port required for Jenkins Master <-> Slave communication

        oc project pitc-jenkins-techlab
        while oc port-forward `oc get pod -l name=jenkins -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'` 50000:50000 2222:2222; do :; done

The ``while`` loop  is required because currently port-forward connections time out after one hour.
Press ``CTRL-C`` ``CTRL-C`` to stop.

Lab 1.3: Jenkins Slave
----------------------
There are two ways to deploy the Jenkins Slave:

**with Docker**

    docker run --net=host csanchez/jenkins-swarm-slave -master https://jenkins-techlab.ose3-lab.puzzle.ch/ -disableSslVerification -tunnel localhost:50000 -executors 2 -name ${TLUSER} -labels ${TLUSER} -username ${TLUSER} -password "${TLPASS}"

**or directly on your machine or in a VM**

1. Create a dedicated, unprivileged user:

        sudo useradd jenkins-slave

2. Download Jenkins swarm client 3.4 into a location accessible by the new user:

        curl -O https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/swarm-client/3.4/swarm-client-3.4.jar

3. Start Jenkins slave with new user:

        sudo -u jenkins-slave -i java -jar swarm-client-3.4.jar -master https://jenkins-techlab.ose3-lab.puzzle.ch/ -disableSslVerification -tunnel localhost:50000 -executors 2 -name ${TLUSER} -labels ${TLUSER} -username ${TLUSER} -password "${TLPASS}"

**Warning:** Running the Jenkins slave directly on your machine with your default user
will give techlab participants access to all your files.

Lab 1.4: Jenkins Folder
-----------------------

1. Login to the techlab [jenkins master](https://jenkins-techlab.ose3-lab.puzzle.ch/) with your techlab account.
2. Create a folder for your techlab projects by clicking "New Item" -> "Folder". Use your username
as the folder name. Click **Ok** and then **Save** on the following screen.

A folder provides a namespace for jobs, credentials and shared libraries. It's recommended
to use a separate folder per project to avoid name collisions and to group related jobs.
In this techlab this is required because each participant creates the same jobs, credentials and shared libraries.
