Lab 18: Write / Migrate your own Projects to Jenkins Pipelines
==============================================================

So you've now learnt quite a lot about Jenkins Pipelines, about the concept and the syntax and about how to write declarative mutlibranch pipelines.
Now it's your turn to start with the implementation and/or migration of your own projects, jobs and pipelines.

Keep the following principles in mind, while doing that:

* keep everything you need to build, deploy, test, & release in version control
* keep even the configuration of your pipelines (triggers, logrotation, ...) under version control in your pipeline scripts
* use the declarative pipelines
* extract functionality in shared libraries for reuse
* keep the jenkins slaves stateless
* use tools to build your software
* have fun!
